# Realms
The current battle is between the Realm of Outworld and Earth.
However this doesn't mean the fighters only come from these 2 realms. 
Kitana comes from the Edenia Realm but wants to help the Earth Realm.

So first let us see to which realm you belong to.

The realms are as follows:
* Earthrealm (aka Earth)
* Outworld
* Netherrealm (aka Hell)
* Edenia (aka Eden)
* Chaosrealm
* Orderrealm (aka Seido)

Implement a Tournament Master that randomly assigns a fighter to a Realm when creating a fighter.
Try to have some feedback from the Master as well like this:
<br/>
<br/>
Hmm, who do we have here?
<br/>
Ah, I see, a Reptile
<br/>
Where shall we put you...
<br/>
Oh, I know...
<br/>
OK Reptile, You will fight for ... Outworld!
