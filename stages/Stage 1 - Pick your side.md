# Realms
The current battle is between the Realm of Outworld and Earth.
However this doesn't mean the fighters only come from these 2 realms. 
Kitana comes from the Edenia Realm but wants to help the Earth Realm.

So first let us see to which realm you belong to.

The realms are as follows:
* Earthrealm (aka Earth)
* Outworld
* Netherrealm (aka Hell)
* Edenia (aka Eden)
* Chaosrealm
* Orderrealm (aka Seido)

Every Fighter is born with a name in a Realm, make sure when a fighter is created he or she is randomly assigned to a Realm.
