# Learn from the master

Unfortunately we don't live in a movie or a computer game. This means our fighter cannot just decide he knows a technique.
In order to known a technique our fighter must train under a Sensei and learn from this master.
<br />
<br />
Our fighter can only say he knows a technique when he has learned with a master for 100 hours on that technique.
<br />
<br />
A sensei can only teach one technique at a time and he never teaches longer than 10 hours in a row.
<br />
Our sensei loves surprises so you never know upfront which technique he will teach in your training session.
