## Rules
* For learning a defense technique we have the same rules as the attacking techniques (see [Stage 3 - Learn from the master](/stages/Stage%203%20-%20Learn%20from%20the%20master.md))
* BUT if the sensei teaches you a defense technique and you do not master (> 100 hours trained) at least 1 of the attacking techniques it defends against, you only get **half** of the sensei his training hours.
* A sensei randomly teaches a defense or attack
* In a randori the 80 hours also count for defense.
