# The final level: The fight

We have learned Attacks, Defenses and we have practiced our skills during our Randori's.<br />
In Japan we call this a Kumite and no longer a Randori.<br />
The Kumute continues until one of the fighters has no HP left.
<br />
<br />
Make sure that the commentator gives enough feedback during the Kumite.

<br />

* Only techniques that have been trained for 100 hours or more can be used.
* A fighter can have a combo for every 100 hours trained with a max of 5 combo's.
    * So a combo of 3 (means 300 hours or more trainend) means the original damage times 3
    * The number of combo's is random (so random between 1 and 3)
* At least one fighter has to know 1 attach techniques with 10 or more hours of training.
* Fighters cannot be of the same realm
