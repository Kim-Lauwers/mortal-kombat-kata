# Randori

We almost have the basics for a first practice fight or as we say in Japanse a Randori.
This is a friendly fight between two fighters at the Dojo.
The Randori continues until one of the fighters has no HP left.

Try to have some feedback during the randori as well. Show all the attacks that are used by the fighters.
After every attack, show the HP from the sparring partner.

<br/>
* Every fighter has 100hp
* Every attacking technique has between 5 and 15 damage (you can choose freely at each attack, hardcoded or random)
* It is a friendly match, so the fighter can use techniques he has trained for 80 hours or more. These techniques only have damage between 0 and 5.
* At least one fighter has to know 1 techniques with 80 or more hours of training.
