# Mortal Kombat Kata
## The Legend
The Emperor of Outworld has his sights set on conquering the realm of Earth. But in order to do so, he has to win 10 straight the ancient Mortal Kombat tournaments. The Emperor's sorcerer, Shang Tsung, has led Outworld's forces to nine straight victories. The only thing standing between Earth and the Emperor's evil forces us humans. Our 3 greatest hero's are Liu Kang, who is only at the tournament to kill Shang Tsung for the murder of his brother, Sonya Blade, a law enforcement officer who was lured to the ship under the pretenses of catching her partner's killer, and Johnny Cage, an egotistical movie star who the press has dubbed as a fake and is only at the tournament as a way to prove himself. It will be up to Lord Rayden to teach our warriors to look deep inside themselves to find the ability to beat Shang Tsung and save the realm of Earth from devastation.

## The queste
Lord Rayden appears in front of you and wants to know if you will help save the Earth.
